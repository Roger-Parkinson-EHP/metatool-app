# Resource-Aware Token Management Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a pragmatic, feedback-driven implementation plan for enhancing MetaMCP's token management with resource awareness capabilities. The plan emphasizes simplicity, rapid feedback cycles, and continuous adaptation based on real-world usage data.

## Guiding Principles

- **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal viable implementations before adding complexity
- **Measure First**: Base design decisions on actual measurements, not assumptions

## Continuous Testing Strategy

Rather than relegating testing to a separate phase, we will integrate testing throughout the development process:

### Automated Tests

- **Unit Tests**: For each component as it's implemented
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Measuring token efficiency and speed
- **A/B Tests**: Comparing different prioritization and compression strategies

### Testing Workflows

1. **Development Workflow**:
   - Editing code files across multiple directories
   - Referencing documentation
   - Debugging errors

2. **Research Workflow**:
   - Gathering information from multiple sources
   - Taking notes and organizing findings
   - Synthesizing conclusions

3. **Content Creation Workflow**:
   - Drafting documents
   - Organizing reference materials
   - Editing and refining content

### Metrics to Collect

- **Token Efficiency**: Information preserved per token
- **Context Relevance**: How well prioritized content matches user needs
- **Resource Coverage**: Important dependencies included in context
- **User Satisfaction**: Qualitative feedback on system effectiveness

## Feedback System

The feedback system will be a core component of the implementation, not an afterthought:

### Data Collection

- **Telemetry**: Automatic collection of usage patterns and system behavior
- **Performance Metrics**: Measurements of system effectiveness
- **User Feedback**: Both explicit (ratings) and implicit (behavior)

### Analysis Pipeline

1. Aggregate metrics from multiple sessions
2. Compare strategy effectiveness across different scenarios
3. Identify patterns and correlations in resource usage
4. Generate insights for system improvement

### Adaptation Mechanisms

- **Parameter Tuning**: Automatic adjustment of weights and thresholds
- **Strategy Selection**: Dynamic choice of prioritization and compression
- **Resource Profiling**: Content-specific behavior adaptation

## Implementation Approach

To ensure we maintain simplicity while building toward our goals:

1. **Start with Standalone Tools**: Begin with independent utilities that can be tested separately
2. **Gradually Integrate**: Connect components as they prove their value
3. **Measure Before Adding Complexity**: Only add features that demonstrate measurable benefits
4. **Maintain Core Functionality**: Keep the system working as we add features

## Conclusion

This implementation plan emphasizes practical, measurable progress with continuous feedback and adaptation. By starting simple, measuring actual usage, and building feedback loops into the process, we will create a resource-aware token management system that effectively addresses real-world needs and continuously improves based on actual usage patterns.
