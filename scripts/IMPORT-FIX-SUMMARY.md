# Unified MCP Server Import Fix - Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Updated SDK Import Pattern**
   - Changed from:
     ```javascript
     const { Server } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/cjs/server/index');
     const { StdioServerTransport } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/cjs/server/stdio');
     ```
   - To:
     ```javascript
     const sdk = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk');
     const { Server, StdioServerTransport } = sdk;
     ```
   - This pattern uses the standard entry point for the SDK, which properly handles the path resolution internally.

2. **Added Diagnostic Logging**
   - Added console messages to verify the SDK loads correctly:
     ```javascript
     console.error('SDK loaded successfully. Available exports:', Object.keys(sdk));
     ```
   - This helps diagnose any issues with the SDK loading process.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added try/catch blocks around server creation:
     ```javascript
     try {
       server = new Server(...);
       console.error('MCP server created successfully');
     } catch (serverError) {
       console.error('Failed to create server:', serverError.message);
       throw serverError;
     }
     ```
   - Added explicit error handler for the transport:
     ```javascript
     transport.onerror = (error) => {
       console.error('Transport error:', error.message);
     };
     ```
   - Added better connection error handling:
     ```javascript
     try {
       await server.connect(transport);
       console.log('Unified MCP server successfully started and connected');
     } catch (connectError) {
       console.error('Failed to connect server to transport:', connectError.message);
       throw connectError;
     }
     ```

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Created README-fixed-server.md to explain the changes and the root cause of the issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the MCP server errors was the way the SDK was being imported. The issue stemmed from:

1. **Junction Point**: The SDK was set up as a junction (symlink) in node_modules pointing to the local typescript-sdk repository.
2. **Path Resolution**: When using explicit module path imports like `sdk/dist/cjs/server/index`, Node tries to resolve this path through the junction point, leading to path resolution issues with duplicated segments.
3. **Import Pattern**: The simplified server implementations already used a more reliable import approach with standard imports that work correctly.

## Verification

The changes were analyzed using tree-sitter to confirm that the import structure was correctly updated. The new code pattern:

1. Uses a safer import approach that avoids path resolution issues
2. Adds diagnostic logging to help identify any issues at runtime
3. Includes proper error handling to provide more helpful information if issues occur

This fix addresses the immediate issue with minimal changes, following the pattern already established in the simplified server implementations within the codebase.
