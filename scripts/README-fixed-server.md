# Unified MCP Server - Fixed SDK Import Path

## Overview

This directory contains a fixed version of the unified MCP server that resolves issues with the SDK import paths. The primary issue was related to how the server was importing components from the SDK, which was causing path resolution problems due to the junction (symlink) setup.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed SDK Import Paths**
   - Changed from explicit module-based imports to the standard SDK import pattern
   - From: `const { Server } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/cjs/server/index');`
   - To: `const { Server, StdioServerTransport } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk');`

2. **Added Diagnostic Logging**
   - Added console.error messages to verify SDK loads correctly
   - Displays available SDK exports for troubleshooting

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added try/catch blocks around server creation
   - Added explicit error handler for transport issues

## Testing

The fixed server can be tested by running:

```
node scripts/unified-server.js
```

You should see output confirming the SDK loaded successfully and that the server started.

## Technical Note

The root cause of the issue was the junction (symlink) in node_modules that points to the local typescript-sdk repository. When using explicit module path imports like `sdk/dist/cjs/server/index`, Node tries to resolve this path through the junction point, leading to path resolution issues with duplicated segments.

Using the standard import pattern (`require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk')`) avoids this problem as it uses the correct module entry point, which properly handles the path resolution internally.

## Future Improvements

For a more permanent solution, consider one of these approaches:

1. **Install SDK from npm**: Remove the junction and install the package directly from npm
2. **Use a package alias**: Set up a local package with the correct path resolution
3. **Standardize imports**: Update all imports across the codebase to use the same pattern

This fix minimizes changes to the codebase while resolving the immediate issue.
