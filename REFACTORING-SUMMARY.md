# Roger-MetaMCP Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Unified Architecture

- Created `scripts/unified-server.js` - A comprehensive server that combines RogerThat, Semantic Analysis, and MCP functionality
- Created `unified-launch.bat` - A new launch script with dependency checking and multiple startup options
- Added robust error handling and graceful shutdown in all server implementations

### 2. Claude Desktop Configuration

- Consolidated multiple server entries into a single MetaMCP entry with all environment variables
- Added the tree-sitter MCP server for code analysis functionality
- Fixed inconsistent backslash escaping in file paths

### 3. Documentation

- Created `REFACTORING.md` with detailed explanation of the changes and migration guide
- Added implementation comments to new code for better maintainability

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Test the unified server implementation with real data
2. Verify that all functionality works correctly in the Claude Desktop environment
3. Ensure error handling is robust in edge cases

### Short-Term Improvements

1. Add automatic discovery of MCP servers in the unified implementation
2. Improve logging with configurable log levels
3. Add better error messages for common failure scenarios

### Long-Term Goals

1. Convert codebase to TypeScript
2. Implement comprehensive test suite
3. Create proper CI/CD pipeline
4. Add monitoring and observability features

## Known Issues

1. Path handling in Claude Desktop configuration assumes specific directory structures
2. Token counting algorithm is simplistic (characters/4) and should be replaced with a proper tokenizer
3. Database connection is not pooled for high-load scenarios

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify unified server starts correctly
- [ ] Test token management functionality
- [ ] Test semantic analysis functionality
- [ ] Verify interaction with Claude Desktop
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify tree-sitter functionality
